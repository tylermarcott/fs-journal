# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This first week's impression of the course and the BCW staff is awesome. The instructors are easy to follow, answer questions clearly and concisely, and all have some level of quirky humor that makes the long sessions of lecture so much easier to deal with and way more fun! Coming from bland college classes, I couldn't have asked for more in coming back to a classroom setting to learn.

I also am really enjoying the social aspect and comradery with my classmates. I feel like I'm lucky and got a batch of really cool people to take the course with. I have talked to and interacted with most everybody at least a little bit, and I feel like I am already developing bonds with a good handful of them. I think this is going to be a lifesaver as we get further into the course, and as the course gets more challenging/ demanding.

As far as the material in the course itself, I am absolutely astounded. I did not expect to cover this much ground and retain this much information in this short amount of time. I feel like I have learned more in the first week of BCW than I did in a whole semester of one of my online college C++ courses. The fact that I can already completely design the cosmetic side of a website is insane! I also did not expect to have this much fun learning the material. It is so exciting getting the hang of this stuff. Learning the process in lecture, and getting ot implement it in lab and see the results. I can't wait for week 2 to see what else we learn!

Towards the beginning of the week, I was definitely struggling a little bit. Having to readjust my sleep schedule has been the hardest part I think. Getting to bed at a decent time each night has been like a trail of fire, and has caused a handful of pretty sleepy days. Luckily, I have roped myself back in to being able to go to bed around 12, if not a little earlier. I think sleep is going to be super crucial for succeeding in this course. I also have had to do a little brain relearning. It's no easy task to sit there and soak up all this information, especially coming from a job where I used my hands more than my brain in day to day. I definitely feel pretty fried at the end of lab each day, but I feel like that is pretty normal after doing something like this for a heavy length of time. I also feel like the more I do it, the easier it will get!

As far as concepts that have been a little harder to grasp, I definitely had a little trouble grasping the whole justify content, align item, align text sort of formatting. It has been hard figuring out which ones to use in which situation, and why some work and others don't for specific applications. I think this is just something that will come with time and repetition. Another hard thing that we learned this Thursday was media queries and position: relation/ position: absolute. i feel like I definitely need to practice these pieces of syntax. That's something I plan on doing this weekend, so I can become more familiar and not forget any of it.

Overall, this first week has been both challenging and rewarding, and I cannot wait for more!
