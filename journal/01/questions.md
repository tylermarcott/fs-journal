# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use Git to navigate files and push code to source control.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It creates a new folder in Git.

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo class is used to apply a special state to a selector, such as selector:hover that can be used to select a button that a user is hovering over and style said button.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > specificity is how specific a rule of css is. Specificity can be used to determine which rule should be applied to an element in the case where there are more than one rules being applied to said element.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > when !important is used on a style declaration, it overrides any other style declarations to that element.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
    ```

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design can help help prevent distractions, help guide people towards choices and contour to accessibility for disabled users. Having certain buttons of items stand out on your page will result in the user more likely clicking buttons. Better design also helps people stay invested/ reading on your site longer.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > To create a clear overview of the page structure, layout, functionality etc. on our web page. Wireframing makes your website a lot easier to design in the long run if you can lay out all the boxes in the very beginning.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > I absolutely think it's worth it. Austin and I built our whole lab website out today first using wireframe. It took quite a while, because the website was pretty long, but it was completely worth it, and things made way more sense visually when we were going back through the website and applying styling.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > an element that contains the display: flex property is able to be altered with relation to the amount of space in the flexed container. Flex boxes are meant to make layouts more flexible and intuitive..

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > Padding, border, margin, and content.
