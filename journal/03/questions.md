# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > It looks like the difference between export and export default is that in export, you have to export all of your modules that you have declared. With default, you don't have to export all of the declared modules.

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > Encapsulation is basically the act of creating a protective layer around our sets of data, which restricts our data from being altered by outside sources

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > Allow for you to provide custom functionality to basic operations that can be performed on an object. Looks like this allows for us to create some error handling in basic code?

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > A class has a defined set of properties. An instance of a class is just a copy of the class itself, so it's not the original.

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > it allows you to put an expression in a bracket that will be used and computed as the property name.

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > To create an organized flow of data, where there is a separation between our data and what the user can see and interact with.

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > A controller controls the flow of data or information to the user and the DOM.

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > Service controls the flow of data to our AppState, and controls how the data is modified.

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > The model is where our templates and classes are defined.
