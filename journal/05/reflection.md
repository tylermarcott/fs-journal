# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

- What would you count as a victory?

Notes 9/7:

once opening a mvc-express project, go to workspace and hit open workspace. This will allow you to open client and server/ run them.

* in .env folder, fill out the bottom 3 tokens with the ones you got from auth0, they will be in slack.

* also have to do this in env.js in our client, copy paste the same tokens for domain, audience and client id

* don't forget your connection string!!!
