Notes Oct 30th:

openvpn <--- Jake says this is a good vpn

vpn = virtual private network

IP = internet provider 

DNS = domain name services

EC2 box in your AWS page, search it and favorite it.

Apparently Oregon is a little bit faster than N CA, maybe select this

Make sure you don't screw up on this: make sure whatever AMI you choose, make sure there is a FREE TIER you can choose. Jake said he likes to us ubuntu

this goes the same with any other selection: make sure it is free tier

you get 750hrs free per month, this is enough for one instance to run free 24/7 every month. If you create ANOTHER free tier, it is not free even if you have free tier selected.

*** worth it to keep your portfolio live.

click create new key-pair

if you are going to store credit card info, make sure to lock your box down pretty good in network settings on AWS

security group name: 'default open everything' or something like this for a default security name

MYSQL/ Aurora <---- Type on Security rule

GUI <--- graphical user interface

^^ on our server we spin up, we won't have a GUI, which is the mouse and such, so we will manipulate the server through the command line

want to install software on the ubuntu machine, like mySQL, node etc.

set up mySQL server so we can make our projects work.


apt <--- your downloader for downloading things on the machine

MySQL server is NOT  a database. A MySQL server is a server that has a ton of databases ON it




sudo systemctl status mysql




^^^^ command to check if the server is running



sudo <---- super user do <--- permission based thing, admin command sort of deal. If you are getting permissions issues, you can run the below code, it will rerun your previous command but with super user do.



sudo !!



**there are bots constantly scraping ip addresses for vulnerabilities



if you see--->  .d <--- damien is the service that actually runs the think that you are doing



nano <--- default text editor on ubuntu

^ this carrot means control on your keyboard. so ^G is just control G

control + c to get out of status check

host address on connect to server in VScode is going to be public id address in AWS


*********for keepr, make some REAL keeps, which will be good for a demo.


make sure to plug in your connection string that will be slacked to us. This will be 







NOTES 10/31:

github actions

YAML <--- whitespace sensitive language




version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/repo-name:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
          ^^^^ I want my internal port 3000 matched to my external port 3000



create new top-level folder called: .github\workflows <---- or maybe the 2 files need to be workflows..?
yah... file... workflows

add 2 files called build.yml and deploy.yml





sudo snap install docker

NOTE:

do step 3 today instead of step 2.


use sudo cat when getting pem key cert



notes 11/1:

cloudflare: come to cloud flare, buy your domain through cloudflare, have them handle your dns

when you create your name, add a type A record, which takes an IP address 

name will be @, ip address will be your ip address

under ssl:

full (strict) encryption mode makes it so you have to install a private key on your origin server, so you are the ONLY one that can read it

have to install origin certificate

origin server -> create certificate

edit nginx, plug in stuff that is in outline

change domain name to your domain name you created on cloudeflare

we are going to cd to the locations of the certificate and key and copy paste the cert and key from cloudflare into these text areas designated in the nginx settings.

in auth0 settings, go to applications, applications, allowed logout URLS, copy paste your url from your page in various spots lol



.net projects like keepr:

change sdk:7.0 to 6.0, that is the version of .net that we have been using

sudo docker ps   <--- shows all your running containers on your server




to push, make a new pull request, then set to production on the dragdown

do a sudo nano, and add route prefix in order to get node AND .net projects working at the same time



NOTES: still can't deploy, go to the build Jake says, and find the other secrets that we need to add into our repo. This is the reason the docker deployment is failing.
