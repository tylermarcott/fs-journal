Notes on General Cloud computing:

Virtualization: allows the possibility have having multiple virtual machines, each running essentially a separate operating system and applications, installed by 1 physical server

	- shared hardware is achieved through a hypervisor, which is a piece of software
	used to create the virtualized environment, allowing for multiple VMs to be installed
	on the same host

		-any request to the hardware goes via the hypervisor

A VM is sometimes referred to an instance (aka our AWS instance we use at bcw)


COMPUTE objects provide the brains to process your workload

STORAGE resources allow you to save and store your data

DATABASE resources alow you store structured sets of data by your application

NETWORK resources provide the connectivity allowing all other resources to communicate with each other

3 different cloud deployment models: Public, Private and Hybrid

Hybrid is used for burst heavy traffic sort of stuff




IaaS - infrastructure as a service

PaaS - platform as a service

SaaS - Software as a service



Key Cloud Concepts:

  On Demand Resourcing
    - when you want to provision a resource within the Cloud, it's almost immediately available to you to allocate where and when you need it

  Scalability
    - cloud computing offers you the ability to rapidly scale your environment's resources both up and down, and in and out

      - scaling up and down is altering the power or performance of an instance, maybe upgrading to one with greater CPU or memory
      - scaling in and out adds or removes the number of instances you're using to your fleet of compute resources

  Economy of Scale
    - the huge scale of resources public cloud offerings provide offers exceptionally low resource costs compared to traditional hosting

  Flexibility and elasticity
    - you can choose the amount of resources you require, how much and how long you want it, and on what scale

  Growth
    - cloud computing offers organization the ability to grow

  Utility based metering
    - with many cloud services, you only pay for what you use.
