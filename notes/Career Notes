Career notes 10/11:

create a featured section in LinkedIn with you resume, landing page and github link in it.

create a skills section

LinkedIn, Resume, github, landingpage  <------ in term of importance for looking for jobs.


Tech Gems networking group <---- do this!!!

Also do virtual networking, reach out to people, find people, follow companies you want to work for, interact with their posts
  * liking, commenting, reposting. Helps with the algorithm.

Find companies that are hiring on linkedin, follow them, interact with them. DON'T just like posts every day. MORE ACTIVITY. Higher it will rank you in the recruiter rating. Makes you the ideal candidate, prove you are going to be engaged and interested.

Spend 2-3 days researching top 10-15 companies you are interesting in working at. Then start looking at the people. Start networking.

hit up developers from the companies you are looking at. I'm new to the industry, can I pick your brain sort of thing, buy you a cup of coffee.

continue to react and interact with these companies, comment on their posts, networks etc



DO NOT be afraid of places that set high hiring standards. Apply anyways.

When you get rejected, which is inevitable, thank them and ask them for feedback.


^^^^^ don't apply to the auto reject email. Play dumb, ask what the next steps are by directly emailing them, not reply to the reject lol.


NETWORKING, ALWAYS NETWORKING.

**** The students that continue to network and code are the students that find success

Students that don't find success stop reaching out, stop coding etc.

*****between the time you apply and the time you follow up with the application is 24 hours max

^^^ follow up, asking what the next steps are, telling them how you are a great fit. All this stuff will set you apart.
