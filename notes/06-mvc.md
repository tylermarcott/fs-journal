# MVC

Design Patterns

new command from BCW:

 * bcw create 

 * choose: mvc

 * make a name for the project

 * initialize git repo

 ----

 A character ***class*** is a blueprint for what a character is(a data object), not a character itself

contructor() <-- special method that runs every time you make a class

key word: this
* this is a context for a class instance to look at itself
